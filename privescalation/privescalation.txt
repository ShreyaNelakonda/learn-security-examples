Privilege escalation is a security issue where an attacker gains higher-level access to a system or application than
they are authorized for. This can occur due to flaws in software or misconfigurations that allow an attacker to elevate
their privileges.
Implementing least privilege principles and proper access controls can prevent privilege escalation attacks.
Least privilege entails giving users or processes only the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks.
Additionally, regular security patching and updates help mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited for privilege
escalation.

Additional security mechanisms:
1) Implementing strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to prevent unauthorized
access to sensitive resources.
2) Monitoring system logs and audit trails for suspicious activities indicative of privilege escalation attempts.
