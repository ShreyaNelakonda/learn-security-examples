Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Information disclosure occurs when sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized parties. For instance, in a web
application, sensitive information like user credentials or database contents might be accessible due to poor
coding practices or misconfigured permissions.
Implementing proper access controls, encryption, and validation mechanisms can prevent information disclosure
vulnerabilities. For instance, ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, restricting
access to authorized users only through robust authentication and authorization mechanisms can help mitigate
information disclosure risks.

Information disclosure violates the confidentiality aspect of the CIA property.
Additional security mechanisms:
1) Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and fix potential weaknesses.
2) Training employees on security best practices to prevent inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information.
3) Utilizing robust logging and monitoring systems to track access to sensitive data and detect suspicious activities
in real-time.
