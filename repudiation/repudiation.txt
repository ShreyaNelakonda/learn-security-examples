- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Repudiation is the denial of responsibility for a particular action or transaction. In the context of security, it
refers to the inability to prove that an action was performed by a specific user or entity, leading to disputes over
accountability.
Implementing robust logging and auditing mechanisms can help prevent repudiation attacks.
By logging all actions taken within a system or application, including user interactions and transactions,
it becomes possible to trace back actions to specific users or entities.

Additional security mechanisms:
1) Utilizing digital signatures or cryptographic techniques to ensure the authenticity and integrity of logged events,
making it challenging for users to repudiate their actions.
2) Integrating workflow automation and approval mechanisms to enforce accountability and ensure that all actions are
authorized and properly documented.
