- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to disrupt the availability of a service by overwhelming it with a flood of requests
or malicious traffic, thereby making it inaccessible to legitimate users.
Implementing rate limiting and traffic filtering techniques can prevent DoS attacks. Rate limiting controls the number
of requests a user can make within a specific timeframe, while traffic filtering blocks malicious traffic based on
predefined rules or patterns.

Additional security mechanisms:
1) Deploying web application firewalls (WAF) to filter and block malicious traffic at the application layer.
2) Implementing network traffic analysis tools to monitor and identify abnormal traffic patterns indicative of DoS attacks.
