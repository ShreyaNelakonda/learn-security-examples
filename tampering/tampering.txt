Tampering refers to the unauthorized modification of data or code, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities
or undesirable behavior in the application. For example, an attacker may tamper with client-side variables or
parameters to manipulate application logic, gain unauthorized access, or perform malicious actions.

Secure practices involve implementing measures such as input validation, data integrity checks,
and server-side validation to prevent tampering. By validating inputs, encrypting sensitive data, and enforcing
server-side controls, developers can ensure the integrity of data and code, mitigating the risk of tampering attacks.
Additionally, employing techniques like code obfuscation and implementing access controls helps deter attackers from
attempting to tamper with the application's code or data.

Tampering primarily violates the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) property of integrity.
By tampering with data or code, unauthorized individuals can modify or alter information, leading to a loss of
trustworthiness, accuracy, or reliability. This undermines the integrity of the data or system, potentially resulting
in incorrect outcomes, unauthorized access, or compromised functionality.
