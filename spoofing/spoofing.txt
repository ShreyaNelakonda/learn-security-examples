Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Spoofing vulnerability often relates to client-side manipulation of data or user interactions.
For instance, an attacker might forge the source of data or events to deceive the application or users.
This could involve falsifying user identities, mimicking server responses, or altering the origin of data packets.

Secure practices involve implementing measures such as input validation, data integrity checks,
and secure communication protocols. By validating inputs and verifying data integrity, developers can ensure that the
information processed by the application is authentic and untampered. Furthermore, employing secure communication
protocols such as HTTPS helps prevent data spoofing during transmission, ensuring that data exchanged between the
client and server remains confidential and unaltered. These practices help safeguard against spoofing vulnerabilities
by ensuring that the application only trusts genuine data and interactions, thus mitigating the risk of unauthorized
manipulation or deception.

Spoofing violates all three CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) properties.
It compromises confidentiality by enabling unauthorized access to sensitive information, undermines integrity by
allowing unauthorized modification of data, and disrupts availability by impairing or denying access to legitimate
users or services. Spoofing undermines the core principles of information security, emphasizing the necessity of
robust countermeasures to mitigate its risks.
